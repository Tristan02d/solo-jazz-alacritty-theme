* Installation

Put the the theme file wherever you want on your system and import it to your
config. I put my themes in ~.config/alacritty/themes/~ . Therefore, I have the
following in my ~alacritty.yml~ :

#+begin_src
 import:
  - ~/.config/alacritty/themes/solo-jazz.yml
#+end_src

You can also copy the theme file content directly to your ~alacritty.yml~.
